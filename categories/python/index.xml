      <description>This article documents how to install Anaconda on Debian based systems.
Mint comes pre-installed with Python (Version 3.x) and legacy Python (Version 2.7). You can confirm the legacy version of Python is installed by opening up a terminal.
In the terminal type:
$ python
For testing python 3.x installation, type:
$ python3
You will most likely see Python Version 3.x is also installed. You can use the 3.x Version of Python, but each time a new package needs to be downloaded, the $ pip3 install command must be used.</description>

      <description>As a former real estate agent, aspiring investor, and software engineer, I have set out to learn more about the data behind real estate. Zillow is an excellent resource to find an overview of the trends going on in the real estate market. For this visualization, I have taken the time to compile the average sales price for residential homes for each state yearly. Zillow provided me with the average sale price of a house for a given state over one month.</description>

      <description>A rocket has been programmed to follow the path $y = x^2$ in space (from left to right along the curve, as seen in the margin figure), but an emergency has arisen and the crew must return to their base, which is located at coordinates (3, 5). At what point on the path $y = x^2$ should the captain turn off the engines so that the ship will coast along a path tangent to the curve to return to the base?</description>

      <description>The quickest way to embed your Jupyter notebooks in WordPress, or any web page, is to create a gist.
 Ensure you have a GitHub account Go to: https://gist.github.com/ Give your gist a file name and include the .ipynb file extension (important) Using a text editor, copy the contents of your [filename].ipynb into the gist. Create the gist as a public gist. Share!  </description>

      <description>Below is a network security project I made on poisoning the ARP cache on a local area network. I successfully intercepted packets between my wireless router and my target windows host. All traffic was monitored and printed to the console. In the projects current revision, it has the ability to print out HTTP packets on port 80 that contain strings likely to indicate that a user submitted a username or password.</description>
