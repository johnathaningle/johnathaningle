      <description>As a former real estate agent, aspiring investor, and software engineer, I have set out to learn more about the data behind real estate. Zillow is an excellent resource to find an overview of the trends going on in the real estate market. For this visualization, I have taken the time to compile the average sales price for residential homes for each state yearly. Zillow provided me with the average sale price of a house for a given state over one month.</description>

      <description>For practice I was setting up a personal home lab for network and penetration testing. When trying to allow everything to run as if it was one LAN network I ran into multiple configuration errors.
Problem: Windows 10 host machine cannot RDP into virtual machine. All ping packets are dropped even though the virtual machine has internet connectivity.
Solution: In VirtualBox, configure the network settings of the host machine to use bridged connection instead of the default NAT connection setting.</description>
