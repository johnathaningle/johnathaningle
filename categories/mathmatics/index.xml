      <title>Essence of Mean Squared Error</title>

      <description>What you need to know: The smaller the means squared error, the closer you are to finding the line of best fit.
Depending on your data, it may be impossible to get a very small value for the mean squared error. Advantage: It is useful if we have unexpected values that we should care about. Abnormally high or low values should be paid attention to.
Disadvantage: If we make a single very bad prediction, the squaring will make the error even worse and it may skew the metric towards overestimating the model’s badness.</description>

      <description>A rocket has been programmed to follow the path $y = x^2$ in space (from left to right along the curve, as seen in the margin figure), but an emergency has arisen and the crew must return to their base, which is located at coordinates (3, 5). At what point on the path $y = x^2$ should the captain turn off the engines so that the ship will coast along a path tangent to the curve to return to the base?</description>
