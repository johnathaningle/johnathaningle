      <description>Question 1 A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. Suppose we feed a learning algorithm a lot of historical weather data, and have it learn to predict weather. In this setting, what is E?
Answer The process of the algorithm examining a large amount of historical weather data.</description>

      <description>Supervised Learning In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.
Supervised learning problems are categorized into &amp;ldquo;regression&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;classification&amp;rdquo; problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function.</description>
